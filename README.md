# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

A command line application that allows the user to generate a team profile HTML page. The page supports an infinite number of team members, options to add an engineer or an intern, mobile users, and the ability to view an engineer's GitHub page.

This project was a nice introduction on how to execute Test Driven Development, as well as using ```npm run test``` to use Jest for testing. It was also a good introduction into using classes in Javascript.
